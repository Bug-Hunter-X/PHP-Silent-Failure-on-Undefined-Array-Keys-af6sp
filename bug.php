In PHP, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with array keys that are not explicitly defined.  Consider this scenario:  If you try to access an array element using a key that doesn't exist, PHP will not throw an error. Instead, it will simply return NULL without any warning. This can lead to unexpected behavior and hard-to-debug issues, especially in larger applications. For example:
```php
$myArray = ['a' => 1, 'b' => 2];
echo $myArray['c']; // Outputs nothing (NULL)
$result = $myArray['c'] * 5; //This will result in a fatal error, since you can't multiple NULL with an integer
```
